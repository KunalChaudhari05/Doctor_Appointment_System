# Doctor_Appointment_System
This project provides a robust API for managing outpatient appointments with a focus on doctor scheduling and appointments. Doctors maintain weekly schedules, practice at one location, and consult a specific number of patients each evening. They are unavailable on Sundays. 

Problem Statement: 

Implement API endpoints for an out-patient appointment system. Doctors practice on a weekly schedule. For simplicity, let's assume they practice on only one location, only on evenings, may consult X number of patients and always leave on Sundays.  API implementation is expected for doctors listing, doctor detail page and appointment booking.
